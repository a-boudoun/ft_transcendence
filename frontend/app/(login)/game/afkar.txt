#set the friction to a small value and reset the vilocity of the ball every time it collids with the boards
#sent the x and w of the {boards, ball} on the sockets according to the dimensions of the canvas
	something like:
			{	x:(Xball / canvasWidth)
	ball
			}	y:(Yball / canvasHeight)
	
# you don't need to send the x and y of the ball to the server, just send it in the beginning and then send the velocity
and after every collition with the boards
