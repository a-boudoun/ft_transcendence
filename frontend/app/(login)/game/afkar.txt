#set the friction to a small value and reset the vilocity of the ball every time it collids with the boards
#sent the x and w of the {boards, ball} on the sockets according to the dimensions of the canvas
	something like:
			{	x:(Xball / canvasWidth)
	ball
			}	y:(Yball / canvasHeight)
	
# you don't need to send the x and y of the ball to the server, just send it in the beginning and then send the velocity
and after every collition with the boards. OR you just have to send the oponent board position 
BUT the walls could move so IT IS A PROBLEM

# create a backend object to hold the game elements positions;
	one for the ball {x, y, w, h, vx, vy}
	one for the boards [ {x, y}, {x, y} ]
	one for the walls
	one for the score

asign every board to the player with the player with the same index in the players array
	players[0] -> board[0]
	players[1] -> board[1]
